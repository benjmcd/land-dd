# Validation Log

Record commands, results, and residual risk.

## 2026-06-03 scaffold validation alignment

**Commands run:**

```bash
git status --short --branch
cd backend && PYTHONPATH=. python -m pytest tests/area_geometry/ -v
cd backend && PYTHONPATH=. python -m pytest tests/reports/ tests/api/ -v
cd backend && mypy app/area_geometry app/domain/area_contracts.py app/reports app/api
C:/Program\ Files/Git/bin/bash.exe ./scripts/verify.sh
```

**Results:**

- Root status no longer lists the nested `001-audit/` worktree after adding it to `.gitignore`.
- Lane B scaffold command now passes: 1 test.
- Lane D scaffold command now passes: 2 tests.
- Targeted Lane B/D type check passes: no issues in 5 source files.
- Full verification passes: agent context check ok, workspace validation ok, JSON check ok (14 files), 22 tests pass, ruff clean, mypy clean (44 source files).
- DB smoke skipped because `RUN_DB_SMOKE=1` was not set and Docker Desktop is still unavailable.

**Residual risk:**

- The root checkout is still an unborn `main` with project files untracked; no baseline commit or push has been performed.
- `origin/main` still only contains the minimal `README.md`; lane worktrees from `main` do not yet contain the project scaffold.
- DB smoke remains unverified until Docker Desktop is running.

## 2026-06-03 repo bootstrap + local index

**Commands run:**

```bash
npx codesight --index
bash ./scripts/verify.sh
git status --short --branch
git remote -v
```

**Results:**

- Codesight v1.14.0 scanned 125 files and wrote `.codesight/`.
- `bash ./scripts/verify.sh` failed in PowerShell because `bash` resolved to the Windows WSL launcher and `/bin/bash` was unavailable.
- Re-ran the canonical gate via Git Bash: `C:/Program Files/Git/bin/bash.exe ./scripts/verify.sh`.
- Full verification passed: agent context check ok, workspace validation ok, JSON check ok (14 files), 19 tests pass, ruff clean, mypy clean (40 source files).
- DB smoke skipped because `RUN_DB_SMOKE=1` was not set.
- Local Git initialized on `main`; `origin` points to `https://github.com/benjmcd/land-dd.git`.

**Residual risk:**

- No commit or push has been performed.
- DB smoke remains unverified until Docker Desktop is running.
- Use Git Bash explicitly on this machine unless PATH is changed; plain `bash` currently invokes the WSL launcher.

## 2026-06-03 isolated lane prompt + generated artifact policy

**Commands run:**

```bash
git check-ignore -v ./.codesight/CODESIGHT.md
C:/Program Files/Git/bin/bash.exe ./scripts/verify.sh
git status --short --branch
```

**Results:**

- `.codesight/` is ignored by `.gitignore`.
- Full verification passed: agent context check ok, workspace validation ok, JSON check ok (14 files), 19 tests pass, ruff clean, mypy clean (40 source files).
- DB smoke skipped because `RUN_DB_SMOKE=1` was not set.
- Git status no longer lists `.codesight/`; all repo files remain untracked because no commit has been made.

**Residual risk:**

- No commit or push has been performed.
- Parallel agents must use isolated worktrees/copies; concurrent writes to the same checkout remain unsafe.

## 2026-06-03 isolated lane prompt hardening

**Commands run:**

```bash
C:/Program Files/Git/bin/bash.exe ./scripts/verify.sh
git check-ignore -v ./.codesight/CODESIGHT.md
git status --short --branch
```

**Results:**

- Full verification passed: agent context check ok, workspace validation ok, JSON check ok (14 files), 19 tests pass, ruff clean, mypy clean (40 source files).
- `.codesight/` remains ignored by `.gitignore`.
- Prompt now includes no-baseline-commit isolation guidance, Windows/Git Bash command notes, test-first protocol, tech-debt controls, shared-log conflict handling, stricter definition of done, and cross-lane stop conditions.
- DB smoke skipped because `RUN_DB_SMOKE=1` was not set.

**Residual risk:**

- No commit or push has been performed.
- DB smoke remains unverified until Docker Desktop is running.

## 2026-06-03 initial workspace generation

Commands expected:

```bash
./scripts/agent-context-check.sh
./scripts/validate_workspace.sh
cd backend && PYTHONPATH=. python -m pytest -q
./scripts/verify.sh
```

DB smoke not run by default because it requires Docker/PostGIS.

## 2026-06-03 local validation in generation environment

```bash
./scripts/verify.sh
```

Result:

```text
agent context check: ok
workspace validation: ok
json check: ok (13 files)
backend tests: 6 passed
verify: ok
```

DB smoke was not run here because it requires Docker/PostGIS. Run it locally after `docker compose up -d db`.

## 2026-06-03 (session 3) — 4-lane scaffold + dependency baseline

**Commands run:**

```bash
pip install psycopg[binary] pytest-cov types-PyYAML
./scripts/verify.sh
```

**Results:**

- Dependencies installed: psycopg[binary], pytest-cov, types-PyYAML.
- engine.py fixed: deferred/lazy initialization (no module-level DB connection).
- contracts.py split into 5 per-lane files; enums.py extended with EvidenceType, AreaType, JobStatus.
- Source registry code migrated to source_registry/ module; shims left in repositories/ + services/.
- Tests split: test_domain_contracts.py → 3 per-lane files; test_source_service.py → source_registry/.
- Full verify.sh: 19 tests passing; lint clean; mypy clean (40 source files).

**Lane scaffold created:**

| Lane | Module dir | Test dir | Plan | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | app/source_registry/ | tests/source_registry/ | plans/lane-a-*.md | state/lane-a-state.md |
| B | app/area_geometry/ | tests/area_geometry/ | plans/lane-b-*.md | state/lane-b-state.md |
| C | app/evidence_ledger/ + claims_engine/ | tests/evidence_ledger/ + claims_engine/ | plans/lane-c-*.md | state/lane-c-state.md |
| D | app/reports/ | tests/reports/ + api/ | plans/lane-d-*.md | state/lane-d-state.md |

**Residual risk:**

- Docker Desktop not running — all DB-dependent gates remain blocked.
- Backward-compat shims in repositories/ + services/ must be archived by Lane A (TA-010) once no code imports from them.
- `app/domain/contracts.py` re-export shim should be cleaned up by Lane D when all lanes have migrated.

## 2026-06-03 T020 — source registry service layer

**Blocker recorded:** Docker Desktop was not running; T010 (DB migration smoke) skipped.

**Commands run:**

```bash
./scripts/verify.sh
cd backend && PYTHONPATH=. python -m pytest tests/test_source_service.py -v
mypy app tests
./scripts/verify.sh
```

**Results:**

- Baseline lint fixed: 3 ruff errors in `config.py` (E501) and `contracts.py` (UP017, UP037).
- mypy installed in Python 3.11 env (`mypy>=1.11`); `verify.sh` typecheck step now runs.
- Source registry repository/service layer added (T020).
- 8 new tests in `tests/test_source_service.py` — all pass.
- Full `verify.sh`: 14 tests passed, lint clean, mypy clean (18 source files).

**Residual risk:**

- DB smoke unverified until Docker is running.
- `InMemorySourceRepository.exists_by_name_org` treats `None == None` as duplicate (stricter than Postgres `UNIQUE(name, organization)` which allows multiple NULL-org rows). Resolve when SQLAlchemy repo is added.
