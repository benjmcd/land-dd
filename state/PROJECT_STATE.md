Verification result:
- 250 tests pass with DB smoke enabled; lint clean; mypy clean (89 source files)
- Local Postgres/PostGIS migrations and seeds apply cleanly, and DB smoke validates required schemas, tables, columns, enums, foreign keys, and seeds
- Source versioning, retrieval lifecycle, caveats, freshness, authority, and license/review/usage-right metadata are implemented and surfaced downstream
- Lane B area/geometry slice now includes a SQLAlchemy/PostGIS `core.areas` repository that round-trips Polygon/MultiPolygon GeoJSON as SRID 4326 MultiPolygon geometry, supports all six Level 4 domain area types with explicit metadata-preserved domain type mapping, preserves source/confidence/validated fields, reads PostGIS-derived area/centroid/bbox metrics, queries fixture spatial relations through PostGIS, and stores immutable prior-geometry rows in `core.area_versions` on geometry replacement
- Lane C evidence/claim/rule-engine slices pass targeted runtime, type, lint, and import-isolation checks; the evidence ledger now has a SQLAlchemy/Postgres repository for `evidence.observations`, durable evidence audit events in `audit.events`, first-class optional evidence geometry mapped to `evidence.observations.geometry`, spatial precision preserved in evidence metadata, DB-backed claim/evidence/verification-task persistence, and evidence-backed not-evaluated UNKNOWN claims for unsupported soil/septic, environmental hazard, resource-context, and market-context categories
- Lane D report runs now persist through `reports.report_runs` and a machine-readable JSON artifact under `OBJECT_STORE_ROOT`
Failed or blocked gates:
- No Level 5 blockers remain in the fixture-backed DB repository path verified on 2026-06-04.
- L5-001 through L5-010: PASS for the DB-backed evidence repository/service scope (source observations, source failures, spatial intersections, derived metrics, document extracts, human verification notes, geometry/SRID/spatial precision, invalid payload rejection, supersession, deterministic retrieval, rollback behavior, durable audit events, and the evidence-ledger persistence ADR are tested or documented)
- L6-001 through L6-010: PASS for Lane C claim/rule scope (claims require evidence links, unknowns require source-failure evidence, severity/confidence stay separate, verification tasks persist, rules are versioned/deterministic, caveats propagate, contradiction/stale/incomplete/source-failure/not-evaluated cases are tested, and rule logic lives in code/config rather than an LLM/UI prompt)
- Level 7 remains PARTIAL until Lane D wires DB-backed API/report-run services and report-run auto-creation of unsupported-domain source-failure evidence.

Next lowest-dependency task:
- Lane D D-000: surface Lane C's not-evaluated unsupported categories in report/API unknowns using stored source-failure evidence; then D-001 can complete DB-backed report/API wiring.
Do not work on yet:
- Live connectors
- UI or LLM summaries
- Production ops/security/observability
- New jurisdictions or intents until Level 7 report/API workflow gates pass
```


## Current objective

Build the foundation vertical slice for the land/locality due-diligence compiler:

```text
source registry -> area geometry -> evidence -> claim -> report run -> API response
```

## Active plan (overall)

`plans/2026-06-03-foundation-vertical-slice.md`

## 4-lane agent architecture (active)

This workspace uses 4 isolated agent lanes, each with dedicated scope, plans, and state files.
See `LANE_OWNERSHIP.md` for ownership boundaries.

| Lane | Scope | Active plan | State | Milestone gates |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lane A | Source Registry + DB Infrastructure | `plans/lane-a-2026-06-03-source-registry.md` | `state/lane-a-state.md` | L2-*, L3-* |
| Lane B | Area + Geometry Domain | `plans/lane-b-2026-06-03-area-geometry.md` | `state/lane-b-state.md` | L4-* |
| Lane C | Evidence Ledger + Claims Engine | `plans/lane-c-2026-06-03-evidence-claims.md` | `state/lane-c-state.md` | L5-*, L6-* |
| Lane D | Reports + API + Platform | `plans/lane-d-2026-06-03-reports-api-infra.md` | `state/lane-d-state.md` | L7-* |

**Each lane agent must read `LANE_OWNERSHIP.md` before any code change.**

## Key constraints

- Bottom-up implementation only.
- Postgres/PostGIS is system of record.
- Evidence-before-claim invariant is non-negotiable.
- No live data connectors before license/source registry/fixture tests.
- No UI or LLM work until the storage/evidence/claim/report spine works.
- Lane agents MUST NOT modify files owned by other lanes.

## Known blockers / undecided items

| Item | Status | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| MVP state/counties | Undecided | Do not hard-code jurisdiction-specific logic |
| Parcel vendor | Undecided | Use fixtures/public source registry only |
| Live connector credentials | Unavailable | No live API/vendor integrations |
| Docker availability | Available | DB smoke now passes locally |

## Last verified state

250 tests pass with DB smoke enabled; lint clean; mypy clean (89 source files). C-002 is merged onto root `main`; D-000 is the next Lane D task.

## Local repo bootstrap state

- Local Git initialized on `main`.
- `origin` is configured as `https://github.com/benjmcd/land-dd.git`.
- Local baseline commit exists on `main`: `ffb73e1` (`Establish governed scaffold baseline`).
- No GitHub push has been performed; `origin/main` remains at `13b75a9`.
- Local Codesight index exists at `.codesight/`; regenerate after significant code changes.
